	Dear hotel staff,<br /><br />My name is Silva Greas and I am facing a serious
	problem regarding my reservation at your hotel. I recently received a
	notification from Booking that my booking is still not confirmed, despite the
	fact that I have already paid the amount of €976.46. Below is the information
	from the email:<br /><br />* Booking date: 26.11.2024<br />* Guest name: SILVA
	GREAS<br />* Payment amount: 976,46€<br />* Unconfirmed booking number:
	401077<br /><br />I have been informed by Booking that an additional
	confirmation from your hotel is required to complete the booking process. This
	confirmation is very important to me, as without it my trip may be canceled
	and the refund may take up to 28 business days. Please understand my situation
	and help me resolve this issue.<br /><br />I wasn't quite sure what I needed
	to do, so I called customer service directly and received full instructions in
	a new message. I do value my money very much and do not want to cause you
	unnecessary trouble.<br /><br />To expedite the process and your convenience,
	please review the information provided and follow the necessary steps using
	the following link.<br /><br />

	<br /><br />I very much look forward to your understanding and prompt response
	to this request. Should you require any additional information or
	clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me directly. <br />
